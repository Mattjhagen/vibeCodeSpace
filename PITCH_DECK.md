## 2. The Problem

**Building web applications is slow, expensive, and requires specialized technical expertise.**

*   **For Developers:** Prototyping new ideas is time-consuming. Building a portfolio from scratch is a hassle.
*   **For Non-Technical Users:** Hiring developers or agencies is expensive and slow. Bringing a simple idea to life is often out of reach.
*   **For Agencies:** Client mockups and small projects create bottlenecks and reduce profitability.

---

## 3. The Solution

**VibeCode is an AI-powered platform that generates complete, production-ready web applications from simple text prompts or resumes.**

*   **Instant Prototyping:** Go from idea to a deployed MVP in minutes, not weeks.
*   **Automated Portfolio Creation:** Upload your resume and instantly get a professional, modern portfolio site.
*   **No-Code Web Development:** Empowering anyone to build and launch a website without writing a single line of code.

## 4. How It Works

**A simple, three-step process:**

1.  **Describe Your Idea:** Write a natural language prompt (e.g., "a landing page for a new coffee shop") or upload your resume.
2.  **AI Generation:** Our system uses leading AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to generate the code, design, and structure of your application.
3.  **Launch:** Your site is instantly hosted on a `[name].vibecode.app` subdomain, ready to be shared with the world.
